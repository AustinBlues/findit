= Find It Nearby

This is based on work started at the Code for America Hack-a-Thon in
Austin, TX on Feb 25, 2012.

The "Find It Nearby" package includes:

* a mobile-friendly web application
* a RESTful web service
* tools for acquiring and processing specific public datasets

The "Find It Nearby" application tries to determine your current
location, and then finds a number of features closest to you. The
implementation for Austin currently locates the following features:

* Fire Station
* Post Office
* Library
* Moon Tower
* Voting Place

This application was created as a "proof of concept" demonstration of
the value of public datasets. Wherever possible, I've tried to use
public datasets that have been published by a local government and
readily available (e.g. on a public data portal).
