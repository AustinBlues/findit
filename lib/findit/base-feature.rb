module FindIt
   
  # Abstract class for a map feature.
  #
  # To implement a feature, the derived class must override the
  # following methods:
  #
  # * self.type
  # * self.marker
  # * self.marker_shadow
  # * self.closest
  #
  class BaseFeature
    
    #
    # Locate an external datafile for this feature.
    #
    # Parameters:
    #
    # * caller -- The full pathname of the file containing
    #   the calling code, i.e. <tt>__FILE__</tt>
    #
    # * dir -- The subdirectory for the datafile.
    #
    # * file -- The filename of the datafile.
    #
    # Returns: The full pathname (String).
    #
    # For example, given a file:
    #
    #   $LIBDIR/findit/local/austin.ci.tx.us/feature/fire-station.rb
    #
    # Making the following call:
    #
    #   self.datafile(__FILE__, "fire-stations", "Austin_Fire_Stations.csv")
    #
    # Would produce:
    #
    #   $LIBDIR/findit/local/austin.ci.tx.us/data/fire-stations/Austin_Fire_Stations.csv
    #
    def self.datafile(caller, dir, file)          
      File.dirname(caller) + "/../data/" + dir + "/" + file

    #
    # Parameters:
    #
    # * location -- A FindIt::Location instance with the location 
    # of this feature.
    #
    # * params -- Parameters to initialize feature attributes. See
    #   the description of the FindIt::BaseFeature attributes for
    #   details on parameter values.
    #

    # * :title => String

    # If both are specified, the <tt>:distance</tt> takes precedence.
    # The <tt>:origin</tt> is used only to calculate distance; the coordinate itself is not saved.
