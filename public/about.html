      <h1>Cycle Nearby</h1>

      <p>The "Cycle Nearby" application will identify features
      relevant to cyclists in Austin, TX that are closest to you. The
      features it knows about are:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>bicycle thefts</li>
	<li>bicycle-auto collisions</li>
	<li>police station</li>
	<li>fire station</li>
	<li>post office</li>
	<li>library</li>
	<li>moon tower (<a
	    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_tower#Moonlight_towers_in_Austin.2C_Texas">huh?</a>)
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When you first start the application it will try to determine
	where you are. Depending on your web browser settings, you may be
	prompted to allow your location to be identified. Once you have been
	located, it will draw a map showing your position and the nearby
	features.</p>

      <p>Here are some things you can do with the map:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Click at a location on the map to see what features are
	  nearby.</li>
	<li>Drag the red "you are here" marker around, to explore a
	  different area.</li>
	<li>Type an address in the search field at the top of the screen to
	  map that location.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Voting Place</h2>

      <p>The "Vote" icon identifies the voting place for the selected
	location.</p>

      <p>The voting place data is for the May 12, 2012 Austin municipal
	election.</p>

      <p>This feature is experimental. Please report any problems to <a
	  href="mailto:chip@unicom.com">chip@unicom.com</a>.</p>

      <p>Known Problem: Travis County did not publish a great data set of
	voting places. I took a list and manually ran "geolocation" on the
	addresses, which failed or provided bogus results for many locations.
	For instance, the precinct 252 voting place is showing the North
	Village Library on the wrong side of Mo-Pac.</p>

      <p>I will see if this can be remedied in future elections.</p>

      <p>Kudos to the Travis County Tax Collector-Assessor office, for
	providing geographic data for voting district boundaries.</p>

      <h2>Powered by Open Source and Open Government</h2>

      <p>In January 2012, the City of Austin released the <a
      href="http://data.austintexas.gov/">data.austintexas.gov</a>
      open government data portal. This application is built on
      publicly available data provided there. At this time, there are
      only a limited number of data collections available, so only a
      small set of features are supported here. What else would you
      like to see? How about driver license offices? Public wi-fi
      access points? If the City releases that information, I'll add
      it to the application.</p>

      <p>This application builds on "Find It Nearby" (see below),
      modified by Jeffrey L. Taylor to include features for cyclists.
      The modifications were started by the "Bike App" team at the
      "Code for America Hack-a-thon", September 2012.  The source code
      is available at <a
      href="https://github.com/AustinBlues/findit">https://github.com/AustinBlues/findit</a>.
      </p>

      <p><a href="">Find It Nearby</a> was written by Chip Rosenthal,
      with support from the "Find It" team from the "Code for America
      Hack-a-Thon", February 2012. The Find It Nearby source is
      available at: <a
