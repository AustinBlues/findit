  <h1>Find It Nearby</h1>

  <p>The "Find It Nearby" (<a href="http://nearby.webatx.us/">nearby.webatx.us</a>)
    application is a free public service. It is designed to demonstrate
    an application of open government information.</p>

  <p>When you start the application, it will try to determine where you
    are. Then, it will search for a number of features nearby, and show
    the closest ones. The features it currently searches for are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>post office</li>
    <li>library</li>
    <li>fire station</li>
    <li>moon tower (<a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_tower#Moonlight_towers_in_Austin.2C_Texas">huh?</a>)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here are some things you can do with the map:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Click at a location on the map to see what features are nearby.</li>
    <li>Drag the red "you are here" marker around, to explore a
      different area.</li>
    <li>Type an address in the field at the bottom of the screen to
      map that location.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In January 2012, the City of Austin release the <a
      href="http://data.austintexas.gov/">data.austintexas.gov</a> open
    government data portal. This application is built on publicly
    available data provided there. At this time, there are only a
    limited number of data collections available, so only a small set
    of features are supported here. What else would you like to see?
    How about police stations? Driver license offices? Public wi-fi
    access points? If the City releases that information, I'll add it
    to the application.
