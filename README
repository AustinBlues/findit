Find It Nearby Service

This is based on work started at the Code for America Hack-a-Thon in Austin, TX on Feb 25, 2012.

The "Find It Nearby" application attempts to determine your current location, and then finds a
number of features closest to you.

At this time, it looks for the following features:

  * Fire Station
  * Post Office
  * Library
  * Moon Tower

The information for this service is published by the City of Austin. This is a demonstration of an
application developed by the general public, using city data.

=== Installation Instructions

1. Setup Ruby

   You must have Ruby 1.9 installed on your system. You also need the following gems:

     * rest-client
     * sinatra

   If you already have Ruby installed, you can be sure these gems are available by running:

     $ gem install rest-client sinatra

2. Start the Web Service

   Run:

     $ ruby ~/workspace/findit/bin/findit-svc
     [2012-02-27 16:09:03] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
     [2012-02-27 16:09:03] INFO  ruby 1.9.2 (2011-07-09) [x86_64-linux]
     == Sinatra/1.3.2 has taken the stage on 4567 for development with backup from WEBrick
     [2012-02-27 16:09:03] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=8765 port=4567

   This starts a local web server. The comment above shows the web server is running on port 4567.

3. Run it.

   Browse the URL:  http://localhost:4567/nearby

   That will run the "Find It Nearby" application. If all goes well, a map will be displayed,
   showing your current location in the center, and markers for each of the closest features.
