Find It Nearby Service

This is based on work started at the Code for America Hack-a-Thon in
Austin, TX on Feb 25, 2012.

The "Find It Nearby" application attempts to determine your current
location, and then finds a number of features closest to you.

At this time, it locates the following features:

  * Fire Station
  * Post Office
  * Library
  * Moon Tower
  * Voting Place

The information for this service is published by the City of Austin. This
is a demonstration of an application developed by the general public,
using city data.

=== Installation Instructions

<<< FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ARE COMPLETELY WRONG FOR CURRENT RELEASE >>>

1. Setup Ruby

   You must have Ruby 1.9 installed on your system. You also need the following gems:

     * dbd-sqlite3
     * sinatra

   If you already have Ruby installed, you can be sure these gems are available by running:

     $ gem install dbd-sqlite3 sinatra

2. Start the Web Service

   Run:

     $ ruby ./bin/findit-svc
     [2012-02-27 16:09:03] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
     [2012-02-27 16:09:03] INFO  ruby 1.9.2 (2011-07-09) [x86_64-linux]
     == Sinatra/1.3.2 has taken the stage on 4567 for development with backup from WEBrick
     [2012-02-27 16:09:03] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=8765 port=4567

   This starts a local web server. The comment above shows the web server is running on port 4567.

3. Run it.

   Browse the URL:  http://localhost:4567/

   That will run the "Find It Nearby" application. If all goes well, a map will be displayed,
   showing your current location in the center, and markers for each of the closest features.

4. Deploy it.

   If you have an Apache 2 server with Phusion Passenger (mod_passenger) installed, you
   should be able to drop this application onto your website and run it. I run the
   application in a virtual website, with DocumentRoot pointed to the "public" directory.

=== To Do List

1. Add additional info links to the info windows.
2. Additional mapping options, e.g. "show more nearby post offices".
3. Catch requests for locations far outside Austin.
4. Document the database.
5. MOOOOORE DATASETS.
